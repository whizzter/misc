BASYNC is a single header C++ async/await system based on the ideas of Simon Tathams coroutine hack for Putty.
Thanks to C++11 and lambdas this system is not tied to any static variables but can be freely instantiated.
(although it does produce some memory allocations if that is an issue for users).

Licenced under a Zlib licence so acknowledgement is nice but not requierd.

See test.cpp for a comperhensive example (compiling the code and running will help visualize that is happening)
